Some student's may explain the problem above by simple referencing the formula $C(n,r) = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. If this happens, praise student understanding and then ask if anyone can explain the reasoning behind the formula. \n",

    "\n",
    "Mushrooms, Pepperoni, Onion is the same as  Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onion and Onion, Mushrooms, Pepperoni.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this permutation-esque conceptualization, we need to divide by how many different arrangements could be made with any the three toppings, as these will be the repeat examples under our current formulation.\n",

    "> *'cancel'* is a common terminology and so used here, but potentially misleading and vague. If you wish to be clarify, albeit verbosely, we can say that matching factors in the numerator and denominator *'cancel'*, because they form a multiplicative identity.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you reviewed 4 major foundational concepts for probability: permutations, combinations, conditional probability and partitioning complex events. Remember that your standard padlock should be more accurately called a permutation lock! Order matters for permutations, whereas only the members of the set are important for combinations. Conditional probability investigates the odds of an event occurring given other information. In these instances, the universal set of possibilities reflects the given information. In the mushroom example, the probability of a mushroom being edible given that it is bruised can be computed by dividing the probability that it a mushroom is both edible AND bruised, by the probability that it is bruised. Mathematically: $$\\large P(edible|bruised) = \\frac{P(edible \\cap bruised)}{P(bruised)}$$. Finally, you investigated partitioning complex events. Often, complex events can be broken into constituent parts, and the total probability can be calculated by combining these smaller events."
