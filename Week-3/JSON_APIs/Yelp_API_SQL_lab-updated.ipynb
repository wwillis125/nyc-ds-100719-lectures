    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how the Yelp API works, it's time to put those API and SQL skills to work in order to do some basic business analysis! Taking things a step further, you'll also independently explore how to perform pagination in order to retrieve a full results set from the Yelp API!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Create a DB on AWS to store information from Yelp about businesses\n",
    "* Create HTTP requests to get data from Yelp API\n",
    "* Parse HTTP responses and insert the information into your DB\n",
    "* Perform pagination to retrieve troves of data!\n",
    "* Write SQL queries to answer questions about your data "

    "## Problem Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab you will analyze the yelp data for a group of businesses to learn more about an industry. You will choose a type of business (Italian Restuarants, Nail Salons, Crossfit gyms) and a location to analyze. Then you will get data from the Yelp API, store that data in a SQL Database on AWS, and write queries to answer questions about the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read through the SQL questions and the API documentation to determine which pieces of information you need to pull from the Yelp API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a DB schema with 2 tables. One for the businesses and one for the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create code to:\n",
    "  - Perform a search of businesses using pagination\n",
    "  - Parse the API response for specific data points\n",
    "  - Insert the data into your AWS DB\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use the functions above in a loop that will paginate over the results to retrieve all of the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create functions to:\n",
    "  - Retrieve the reviews data of one business\n",
    "  - Parse the reviews response for specific review data\n",
    "  - Insert the review data into the DB\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Using SQL, query all of the business IDs. Using the 3 Python functions you've created, run your business IDs through a loop to get the reviews for each business and insert them into your DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Write SQL queries to answer the following questions about your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus Steps:  \n",
    "- Place your helper functions in a package so that your final notebook only has the major steps listed.\n",
    "- Rewrite your business search functions to be able take an argument for the type of business you are searching for.\n",
    "- Add another group of businesses to your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- What percentage of businesses have a rating greater than or  4.5?\n",
    "- What percentage of businesses have a rating less than 3?\n",
    "- What is the average rating of restaurants that have a price label of one dollar sign? Two dollar signs? Three dollar signs? \n",

    "Returning to the Yelp API, the [documentation](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search) also provides us details regarding the API limits. These often include details about the number of requests a user is allowed to make within a specified time limit and the maximum number of results to be returned. In this case, we are told that any request has a maximum of 50 results per request and defaults to 20. Furthermore, any search will be limited to a total of 1000 results. To retrieve all 1000 of these results, we would have to page through the results piece by piece, retriving 50 at a time. Processes such as these are often refered to as pagination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have an initial response, you can examine the contents of the json container. For example, you might start with ```response.json().keys()```. Here, you'll see a key for `'total'`, which tells you the full number of matching results given your query parameters. Write a loop (or ideally a function) which then makes successive API calls using the offset parameter to retrieve all of the results (or 5000 for a particularly large result set) for the original query. As you do this, be mindful of how you store the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: be mindful of the API rate limits. You can only make 5000 requests per day, and APIs can make requests too fast. Start prototyping small before running a loop that could be faulty. You can also use time.sleep(n) to add delays. For more details see https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/rate_limiting.**"
