    "# Text Classification Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "This assessment is a text classification project where the goal is to classify the genre of a movie based on its characteristics, primarily the text of the plot summarization. You have a training set of data that you will use to identify and create your best predicting model. Then you will use that model to predict the classes of the test set of data. We will compare the performance of your predictions to your classmates using the F1 Score. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The **movie_train.csv** dataset contains information (`Release Year`, `Title`, `Plot`, `Director`, `Cast`) about 10,682 movies and the label of `Genre`. There are 9 different genres in this data set, so this is a multiclass problem. You are expected to primarily use the plot column, but can use the additional columns as you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have identified yoru best performing model, you will create predictions for the test set of data. The test set of data, contains 3,561 movies with all of their information except the `Genre`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of tasks that you will definitely want to complete for this challenge, but this list is not exhaustive. It does not include any tasds around handling class imbalance or about how to test multiple different models and their tuning parameters, but you should still look at doing those to see if they help you to create a better predictive model.\n",
