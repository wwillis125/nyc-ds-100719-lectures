Your Turn:
Now you are going to work with a partner to create a class. 
Your class will construct a descriptive statistics calculator using our functions from earlier.

Your class should have the following attributes:

.data - where you will hold your data
.length - that tells you the length of your data list
.mean
.median
.variance
.stand_dev
Your class should have the following methods:

.add_data() - which can take in a value or a list of values and extend the .data attribute
.remove_data() accept a list of numbers and remove any of the numbers in that list from your object data
Bonus:

- calc_correlation(second_variable) this method should accept a list of data for the second variable, 
and then calculate the correlation coefficient for the two variables.
